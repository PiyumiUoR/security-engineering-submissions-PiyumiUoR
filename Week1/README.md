## Task 4B

**Has your account details leaked?**

Yes, as per the haveibeenpwned results I have been pwned and no pastes reported. The case was a well-known data breach incident in Sri Lanka. 
As per the Twitter alert the attackers got into the website and vandalized it before sending significant amounts of data to their servers. The warning further stated that the database dump and the source code were also taken. Unfortunately, there is no way to independently confirm the veracity of these assertions. This warning on PayHere's official Facebook page claimed that the attackers had also compromised their SMS Gateway.

The PayHere response for the incident is in ```https://blog.payhere.lk/ensuring-integrity-on-payhere-cybersecurity-incident/```.

The issue is, although I have not created any accounts in PayHere, having my data leaked. The moment I realized my data had been leaked was the time I checked my email in haveibeenpwned. 

**Screenshot of haveibeenpwned search, you can redact information if you want.**

**Did you change passwords and/or email + password combos, that were leaked, if not, do it.**

Yes, I changed my passwords a few times in the past 2 years.
